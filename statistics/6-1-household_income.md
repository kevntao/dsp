[Think Stats Chapter 6 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2007.html#toc60) (Household Income)

#####Problem: Compute the median, mean, skewness, and Pearson's skewness of the resulting sample. What fraction of households reports a taxable income below the mean? How do the results depend on the assumed upper bound?


Assuming largest income is $1,000,000  
> Mean:  74278.7075312  
> Standard Deviation:  93946.9299635  
> Median:  51226.4544789  
> Skewness:  4.94992024443  
> Pearson's Skewness;  0.736125801914  

Assuming largest income is $10,000,000  
> Mean:  124267.397222  
> Standard Deviation:  559608.501374  
> Median:  51226.4544789  
> Skewness:  11.6036902675  
> Pearsons Skewness;  0.391564509277  

Assuming largest income is $100,000,000  
> Mean:  457453.487247  
> Standard Deviation:  4434938.61283  
> Median:  51226.4544789  
> Skewness:  14.8924598044  
> Pearsons Skewness;  0.274790973381
